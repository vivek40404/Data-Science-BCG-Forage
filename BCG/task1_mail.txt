Subject: Approach to Tackling PowerCo's Issue
Hi [AD's Name],
Hope you're doing well. Estelle and I looked into PowerCo's issue and wanted to share how we plan to dig deeper and find a solution. Here's a straightforward breakdown:
Defining the Problem:
Our focus is on understanding why customers leave PowerCo. We'll use a step-by-step plan:
1. Understand the Business: Figure out why customers stay or switch energy providers.
2. Get the Right Data: Look at customer data from the past 5 years, including where they're located.
3. Clean and Prepare the Data: Make sure the data is good for analysis.
4. Use Models: Use computer programs to predict why customers might leave.
5. Check and Learn: See if our predictions match what's happening and find ways to fix it.
Factors Influencing Decisions:
We think pricing, clean energy efforts, customer service, and location are big factors.
Data Needed:
To understand this better, we need:
- Customer purchase history
- Where customers live
- Records of customer service
- Pricing info over time
How We'll Look at the Data:
1. Group Customers: See if we can group customers based on their buying habits.
2. Look at Trends: Check for patterns in customer behavior over the past 5 years.
3. Map Where Customers Are: See if where customers live is linked to them leaving.
4. Check Relationships: Look at how pricing changes, clean energy efforts, and service affect why customers leave.
Next Steps:
Once we have this info, we'll analyze it to understand why customers might leave and figure out how to fix it.
Let us know if you have any thoughts or anything to add.
